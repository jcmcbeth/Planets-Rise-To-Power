SWR2 Refactor revision 294
--------------------------

Before using this program please read all the license files in the 
~/swr-2.0/doc/ directory. Running this program implies understanding
and acceptance of any terms outlined therin.

To run the mud change to your home directory and run the 
startup script by typing:

./run-swr &

To connect to the mud telnet to port 9999. To change the default port you
can either run the startup script using the desired port number as a 
command line argument or edit the script.

To give your character all the commands first save and quit. Then locate your 
player file in the ~/swr-2.0/player/ directories. Edit the line that says 
Toplevel changing the number from 1 to 200. Then log back on. Type "holylight"
and "config +roomflags" for full immortal vision.

Oh yeah,
This code is unfinished and buggy...

Enjoy
