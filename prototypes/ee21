#PROTOTYPE
Name         EE21 Light Patrol Spacecraft~
Filename     ee21~
Description  The EE22 Patrolship is quick and manueverable making it a good spacecraft
for patroling starsystems and investigating possible threats.   However
its light armament makes it poorly suited for heavy combat.  Also its lack
of a hyperdrive further limits its uses.
