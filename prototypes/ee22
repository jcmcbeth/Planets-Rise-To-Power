Name         EE22 Long Range Patrol Spacecraft~
Filename     ee22~
Description  EE22 Patrolcraft are identicle to the EE21 spacecraft except for the
addition of a hyperdrive and a slightly larger fuel supply.  This makes
them ideal for patroling remote sectors of a starsystem as well as
undeveloped regions of space.  However, like the EE21 the spacecraft is
not suited for heavy combat.
