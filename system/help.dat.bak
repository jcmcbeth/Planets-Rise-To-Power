.
   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

1 BUILDING CONSTRUCTION LANDSCAPING SURVEYING BRIDGES BUILD~
New planets are created as they are found with the EXPLORE command. 

In order to build on a planet you must:

A. Belong to the clan the controls the planet.
B. Be "empowered" by your clan to build.
C. Know the building skills/commands...

bridge ....... connects rooms on a planet (skill)
landscape .... used to alter the apearance of a planet (skill)
construct .... build new areas on a planet (skill)
survey ....... get information about a room (skill)

For people desiring to expand their planets heres the advice I offer. Since
you can't delete existing exists, I suggest that you start by building a
road from the colonization center to an new area. You do this by changing
the descriptions and sectors of the rooms with "landscape."  To start
building your new area you use the "construct" comand wich starts a new
room in the direction you supply. Finish that room with "landscape." You
can also use "survey" at any time to get info about a room.  Try to keep
your area well ballanced. Read the help file called "taxes" and check
"showplanet" often.  Remember to build barracks and control towers.
Leaving your area unprotected could result in its capture by opposing
forces and the ultimate destruction of all your hard work.

-1 DIKU~
Realms of Despair was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)

          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.
~

200 EXPLORE~
Explore 
 
Syntax: explore (star system) (planet name)
 
Rules for star system and planet naming.
  
1. Do NOT chose star wars themed planet names or systems.
 
2. Do not chose a proper name like John or Mary for the planet or system
name. 
  
3. Do not chose a name from TV series shows, clear them first with an
immortal to make sure that it is ok to use. For example don't name your
planet Caprica because the battlestar galactica reference WILL be noticed.

1 NEWBIE~
If you are new to mudding this mud might be a liitle difficult to learn on
but I guarantee the experience will be rewarding.

The help files are pretty vague right now but offer a good starting place.
Typing "help" by itself will point you in the right direction.

If you have played any SWR muds before you will notice ALOT of changes in
this version of the code. A major change is how much emphasis is placed
on controling planets and having them almost entirely build by the clans
that control them. Another change you will notice is that spacecraft are
built on demand when you buy them. No more searching around for one for
sale. Just type in the mode you want built for you and voila.

Have fun.

1 RULES LAW PK SPAM POLICY PUNISHMENT RP BAN SITEBAN NAMES~
There are only a few rules and they are pretty straight forward. 
  
1. Behind every character is a real life flesh and blood person. Treat each
of those people with respect and dignity as if you were speaking face to
face. Keep disputes between characters, between characters, not between the
players behind them. 
  
2. This is a roleplaying mud although its not enforced. Please try to keep
your character's actions in-character. If you want to discuss things that
your character wouldn't know about such as the fact that you are playing a
game or "real life" stuff please use the "out of character" channel, OOC.
  
3. Spam is bad. Avoid spam. Do not be a spammer. 
  
4. This is an RP encouraged mud so don't go about asking people stuff on
OOC that normally would be asked IC and for the sake of arguement this is
to keep RPers happy because if one person is allowed to doit then everyone
has to be allowed to do the same
Same goes for IC stuff on the OOC channel, don't doit. 
  
5. If your name consists of random letters or something along the lines of
tubulardude39 then you are in the WRONG place mate, appropriate RP name is
the only real requirement for play other then that the mud is still not RP
enforced. 
  
6. Do not argue on OOC over something done IC and certainly do not argue
with an IMM about a decision made. ALL immortals have final say in all
matters arguing is the quickest way to being silenced. 
  
7. Have fun!

1 TAXES REVENUE INCOME POPULATION "POP SUPPORT" CITY CITIES FARMLAND WILDERNESS~
Orgizations receive revenue from the planets they control. This revenue is
based on a monthly rate and is paid in hourly installments. The revenue is
generated from a combination of taxes and resource production with
maintenance costs subtracted. The following things affect the total
revenue: 
  
Population...... The higher a planets population the more taxes you receive.
                 A higher population also increases the amount of resources
                 that can be produced. 
Citysize........ Population increases with the size of a city. 
Farmland........ Population is limited based on your food supply. Although
                 food is collected from the wildness, farmland provides a
                 much greater amount. 
Wilderness ..... Areas covered by a planets natural habitat provide a
                 planets total resource base.  

Popular support. The support of the people towards the planets government
                 can drasticly increase or decrease a planets maximum
                 popultaion and thus affect its revenue.

Military........ The cost of supporting a planets military is subtracted.
Automated Ships. The cost of maintaining defensive fleet is subtracted.
Barracks........ The number of barracks on a planet increases the size of a
                 planets army.
Control Towers.. The number of control towers a planet has affects the
                 size of its defensive fleet.

1 TERMINALS TERMINAL BOARDS NOTES MAIL~
note write...... Begin composing a message
note post....... Upload your message to the terminal
note read....... Read a message on the terminal
note list....... List all messages posted on the terminal 
note to......... Address a message
note subject.... Sets a messages subject
note remove..... Deletes a message from the terminal 
note show....... Look at a message in progress
note take....... Downloads a message onto a portable data disk

mail............ Mail commands are the same as note commands but used
                 at mail terminals. ie. "mail write", "mail list", etc.
